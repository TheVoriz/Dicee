# Dicee
 The Dicee app is a simple dice rolling application. When the user presses the "Roll" button, the app randomly generates two dice images. 
The dice images are selected from an array of dice images using the randomElement() method. Each time the button is pressed, the dice images are updated with new random values, simulating the roll of two dice. It provides a fun and interactive way to simulate rolling dice, which can be used for various games or activities that require dice.
